                        Hi, I'm Javi. I love creating things that people all over the world can interact with.
                        I took a beginners coding class when I was in high school and my interest in tech and coding blossomed from there.
                        I put my interest in programming on hold for a while to explore career options in restaurants.
                        I realized that restaurants don't provide the work-life balance I'm looking for, so I turned back to coding around summer of 2022
                        and have been working towards my goal to become a software engineer ever since.
